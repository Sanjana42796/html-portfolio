  <h3>Happy marriages begin when we marry the ones we love and they blossom...............
  </h3>
  <p>Marriage is the legal or formal recognition of union between two people. 
  Marriage symbolizes the love of two people until death do them part. 
  Marriage is a risk people take despite the various odds against it. 
  People get married for a variety of reasons because of religious beliefs, societal pressure, and obligations.
  Marriage is a commitment between two individuals, a legal joining of a man and a woman as spouses. 
  When we talk about marriage we think of a long-term relationship that clearly involves love, friendship, support of your other half and of course patience. 
  Marriage is a traditional form of love, it unites two individuals, their families and their cultures together.
  It is a blessed action that one might take, before going for marriage one must ask themselves that are they really prepared for this huge commitment
  for the reason being that it involves the life of two people who love each-other and want to live the rest of their life supporting and tolerating each-other
   through tough and blissful situation.</p>
